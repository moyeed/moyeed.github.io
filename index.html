                <p>As a Research Assistant, I have been working on trajectory visualization of AIS marine data using various modules like numpy, 
                    pandas, pydeck and parquet in python with object-oriented programming concepts. I was able to develop and refactor already 
                    present code towards more object-oriented approach that helped in improving the usability and efficiency of algorithms.

                   <ol>
                    <p>We have developed AVA (Virtual Assistant) for handling user queries from basic FAQ to ticket related issues,
                         which would connect with a live agent if necessary. we have deployed the virtual assistant successfully over 
                         Teams, SMS, Voice and Web based modality to around 35,000 users which has reduced 25% of calls 
                         that were being answered by the live agent directly initially and it moved towards 40% as we have provided 
                         new features and resolution of bugs as early as possible by following Agile process which improved the efficiency 
                         and number of users that use the assistant every week. We have used various AWS services like Amazon Lex as chatbot platform, 
                         Amazon Lambda, API Gateway, Dynamo DB as NOSQL database, elastic Cache, Elastic search, Comprehend, Connect, SQS, SNS, and step functions.

                <ol>
                <p>Description: We have worked on predicting jobs based on scholorly research articles published in past years, for current project we have focussed on
			4 topics i.e. Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Robotics. We have collected Jobs from indeed by scraping it with it's API, 
			we were able to collect 1000 jobs for each topic and research articles were collected from Dimensions for each topic 50k papers were collected.
			Once the data collection was done, we had perfoermed basic data visualization and then topic analysis on Jobs and research articles of each topic
			then visualized the corealtion between each topic's Jobs and research papers. The research question that we were going answer with this project was if there was a 
			corealtion between jobs and research articles and if yes, which year research articles were more corealtion to the jobs that were posted in 2021, we have
			found that older papers(2016) were more corelated to Jobs posted in 2021. Besides this we have also calculated the cosine similarity between each topic's Jobs and Papers
			to be able to recommend jobs based on research article's Abstract. We have worked on a subset of total dataset, we were facing problems with limitations 
			of Indeed API to collect all Jobs, this analysis helped us understand the corealtion between then exists and further uderstand that research papers were
			impacting jobs posted few years after they were published.</p>

                <ol>
                <p>Description: We had worked on developing two, 5 layer convolutional nural netwrok which had to predict the age and gender of a person based on the image given, 
			we were abel to get an accuracy of 87% on Gender prediction whereas a 55% of accuracy on Age. The training was performed on ADIENCE dataset which had 26,500 images sized about 1 GB.
			The final predictions on age was divided into 8 classes i.e., (0-2, 4-6, 8-13, 15-20, 25-32, 38-43, 48-53, 60+). Our Convolutional network was less complex
			and was matching or overcoming accuracy of many other published convolutional network for same purpose but we could not overcome the state of the art model's accuracy.
			Besides just creating the model, we have worked with openCV to cretae and local application that uses the webcam to capture any person's image through vodeo processing 
			and shows the age and gender on the screen while the video is running. </p>

                <p>Description: This project was for exploring the elasticsearch, a faster search based on Inverted index search method developed with help of Lucene. It provides a 
			faster way of accessing or filtering text from huge data, it provides various types of queries to get approriate results which were explored and analysed 
			as a part of this project.  </p>

                <ol>
                <p>Description: I have implemented from scracth the naive bayes model for prediction of hand written numbers(MNIST data), 
			In the process 5000 images were trained and 1000 images were classified with an accuracy of 77.3%.
			The model is further evaluated by creating a confusion matrix and applying laplace smooting.</p>

                <ol>
                <p>Description: As a Research Assistant, I have been working on trajectory visualization of AIS marine data (which has lot of
                    information on different vessels, with precision of minutes) using various modules like numpy, pandas, pydeck and parquet
                    in python with object-oriented programming concepts. The main responsibilities include, refactoring already present code
                    to improve the efficiency of the program and research on various bundling methods of appropriate trajectories.</p>
                <p>please find one of the initial visualization that was projected below.</p>

                <ol>
                <p>Description: This project was developed under research and development wing of our college, which aimed to analyze and
                    build a Segway that would allow transportation within campus with a battery powered vehicle. The final product was able to
                    carry a 100 kg person with an optimal speed of 4 km/h.</p>

                        <p>Description: We, as a team of 30 members have developed two robots, one of which was made Autonomous with
                            the help of computer vision and algorithms. Manual robot had to pick up the ball and hand it over to autonomous
                            bot and it would base on color of the ball would have to go to a specific location and throw the ball at a certain
                            distance.</p>

                        <p>Description: We have developed a frisbee throwing robot, as per requirement the frisbees should be thrown at
                            different trajectories to complete the task. We have used various sensors and embedded C programming to be able
                            to achieve the task.</p>

                        <p>Description: We have developed two robots, ECO bot and Hybrid bot, according to the theme, the hybrid bot has to
                            power ECO bot to move along a course without using the internal source of energy and then finally the hybrid bot
                            had to climb a pole to end the task.</p>
